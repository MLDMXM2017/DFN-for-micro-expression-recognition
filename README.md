The source code of this papaer,"The Heterogeneous Ensemble of Deep Forest and Deep Neural Networks for Micro-expressions Recognition."  

# Usage
## Dataset Preparation
you may put the apex and flow data into the folder "train_test_data_argument"  

## Get the gc results
Firstly, you can run the command to get the gc results:
```bash
cd gcForest_master
bash run_gcforest.sh
```

## Run the DFN network for ME recognition
Then, you can run the command to run the DFN network:
```bash
bash run_DFN.sh
```
# Requirements
The requirements of DFN can see the requirements.txt
